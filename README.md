# touchscreen-graduation-cap-decoration
I decorated my cap and gown with a 7" Raspberry Pi Touchscreen monitor. Here is a album of the final results! [ALBUM COMING]

In order to get the monitor on my graduation cap, I 3D printed a custom-made stand from PLA using a MakerBot Replicator 5. This repository includes the Solidworks assembly of the stand, graduation cap, monitor, Raspberry Pi, and other appropiate parts. STEP AP203 and STEP AP214 files of all the parts are included and .makerbot, .stl, and .thing files of the custom stand are included as well.

Consider the dimensions of the 3D models that are not critical to the assembly of the stand to the monitor as wrong. I didn't model them for accuracy or detail.
